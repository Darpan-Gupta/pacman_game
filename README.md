# Pacman_game
This project is a **fun** recreation of the classic arcade game, Pacman. The game is developed using C++ and SDL2 library.

## Game Overview
The objective of the game is for the player to control Pacman and navigate through a maze while collecting points and avoiding ghost. Unlike the original Pacman this game is having only one ghost which is little slower than pacman itself, but is very efficient in finding the shortest distance to Pacman because it uses breadth first search, and it gives a feeling of police chasing thief so I used Subway Surfers audio( credit to subway surfers music creater and team )
